### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm darth, I'm mostly busy with my work, but occasionally have some free time to learn something new (such as, how to make incremental/narrative games) or play with some publicly available data (e.g. stats for Russian Unified State Exam, or Archive of Our Own engagement stats), which I usually publish here.
